                <p>Money doesn’t just pop up from nowhere; it represents a trust system in a common society. It could be a coin, digits, or anything feasible to trade.<br>People are the foundation. Money as a scale networks people to a whole society.<br>Price is weighed by labor, but labor nowadays is leveraged by a common belief of scarcity balanced in the market, which might subjectively derail from real value. Reasoning from zero, the core to making solid money is to build one’s scarcity, no matter by technology, negotiation, or strategy.<br>With respect to various financial derivatives, people’s beliefs swing dramatically, and the fortune rank is up to one’s own self-identity. Therefore, we have to distinguish between assets and incomes. The former is based on sheer beliefs, while the latter makes up fluid life. Just like Apollo and Dionysus in casinos, there would be chaos and disorder if we mixed them up.<br>Generally, we can model the whole process into an interactive loop. 2 subjects, human and money interact based on restricted rules. Since the operations are fixed within rules, the interactions work like a game. Hence it would be wise for humans to treat this as a game of fortune, where money is the token. Then we can draw some conclusions as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Game has to be victory and defeat; every dog has its own day. </li>
<li>Rewards only come to those who revere the game rules.</li>
<li>There are other players in a game. The individual is unpredictable while the whole is. </li>
<li>Regrets aren’t available; only experiences can be adjusted and tuned.</li>
<li>It’s never too late to renew it!</li>
</ol>
<p>Game is for people to play. People have their own reasons to play a game but it couldn’t be money. Money is a token, the medium to play a game. Maybe for the old minds, it’s unwise to put money into game. However, game itself takes others’ labor to improve the services, including response speed, visual images, mental satisfaction, etc. Our money invested guarantees our acknowledgment for all the work involved, encouraging the whole game to be better. Whatever the reason is happiness, relaxation, or achievements for social interactions, once the aim is set, the only core in a game is to reach the aim at all costs. Money comes and goes. We know that. What entrenches into our minds are the moments and people involved. Sometimes it’s worthy of grandiosity, leveraging money for high-end services.</p>
<p>Thanks to each other’s contribution to their unique scarcity, the whole society is geared forward, no longer limited by population, time, or natural resources. As people’s concepts about money evolve after rounds of economic ups and downs, the strategies of our society’s operations correspond. Why do IT leaders take the place of traditional automakers? Why do businessmen get involved with politics? Why do nations begin to torture under such progress? Maybe I can’t answer them all here, but it’s meaningful to inspire thoughts.</p>
<p>the core of marketing and merchandise, making info reach the target customers. In this pipeline, they need to either uncover the potential customers or uncover their potential needs. With respect to physiology, sociology, anthropology, etc, people are caged in their cognitive level. Intentionally or unexpectedly, it would be better to maintain the status quo, avoiding unnecessary misunderstanding and even hatred. Living within such a complex society, there are certain structural holes with bonuses and risks. Aligning with the nation’s strategy, it might raise you with fortune. Instead, it could ruin you without mercy.<br>There is an interesting motto I’d like to share here:<br>When power controls money there is still hope…And when money controls power there’s nothing left because money and power come under one. </p>
<p>As a free market evolves, money would gradually settle and evaporate since monopoly takes over. At the same time, hot money, investment, and consumption expectations fade following the fragility of the economy. Globally, nations dilute and share the risks of manipulating trade and tariffs. Up till now, there are only 2 ways to fix this, leveraging the stored money by new technologies OR resetting the social assets by new wars.</p>
<p>Ever since Keynesianism saved the US from the Great Depression, nations have come to a deal with their people. By invigorating liquidity, the economy is spinning in a circle. People devote their efforts to work for proper causes. When chasing their wild dreams, society benefits from them. While people may not always be effective in their concerns, nations guard the general progress of society. It’s sad to admit that progress takes. WLB is an eternal topic for modern people. The Mars rockets could flame the souls bathed. Luckily, if the economy keeps growing, people could stand together to make a bigger cake. That’s why nowadays people are indulging in tech innovation, which promises a period of prosperity. However, when it’s staggering with too many bubbles, people become cautious and so does the whole world,  when anger is bursting the inequality of division. </p>
<p>It seems a systematical bug ever since humans evolved into a private ownership society. Pioneers and predecessors have been contributing their wisdom to fix it. After trials and adjustments, we are orienting a long-term optimal solution. However, to reach the destination in one piece, we have to survive the short-term difficulties right ahead. That’s where the truth hides.</p>
<p>Last but not least, as emerging fintech such as blockchain develops, what we have known might be significantly overturned. Compared to real estate, digital assets could be appreciated more. Further, the top value of one person could be marked by credits or trust, which facilitates financial operations in our society. In that case, isn’t it silly to focus on some small profits, ignoring the whole iceberg? The game rules are gradually changing, but humanity remains. Before we build up a fair distributive mechanism after conflicts and compromises, it’s wisdom to dance in dynamic packets. </p>
<p>Sorry for wrapping up sort of anticlimactic, but don’t take a fortune too seriously. The number is just a game, whose rules are articulated by the upsiders. If one gets sucked in by a game instead, it’s doomed to be poor. Wax and wanes, ebb and flow, code of conduct, what remains constant is the inner wisdom of humanity. Hope I could enjoy the whole game of Fortune as well.</p>
